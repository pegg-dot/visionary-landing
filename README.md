# Visionary Early Access Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for an early‑access landing page for **VISIONARY**.  
VISIONARY is a transdermal caffeine patch engineered for smooth, calculated energy — move by move, hour by hour.  

The page is a single‑file React component styled with Tailwind CSS.  It features:

* A hero section explaining the unique value of VISIONARY.
* A waitlist sign‑up form with validation, bot honeypot and success/error states.
* Sections explaining how the patch works, key benefits, testimonials, and FAQs.

This code is meant to be embedded into a Vite/React project.  For full setup instructions, consult the repository documentation or the comments within `App.jsx`.
